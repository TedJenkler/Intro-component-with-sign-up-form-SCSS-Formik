## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e., a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My Process

### Built With

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A frontend build tool for fast development with a modern workflow.
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - For advanced styling and creating flexible, maintainable stylesheets.
- [Formik](https://formik.org/docs) - For managing form state and handling form validation in React applications.
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) - For schema validation and error handling in forms, commonly used with Formik.

### What I Learned

During this project, I gained more experience in the following areas:

- **SCSS:** Realized that deeply nested SCSS can become difficult to manage. Moving forward, I'll aim to minimize nesting in larger components to maintain clarity and ease of maintenance.
- **Formik and Yup:** Learned to efficiently manage form state and validation using Formik and Yup, which streamlined the process of handling user input and error messages.

### Continued Development

- **Plan to further improve responsiveness**: Enhance the layout and design to ensure the application looks great on all devices, including tablets and small screens.
- **Add more details and improve animations**: Introduce additional visual elements and animations to enhance user experience and engagement.
- **Explore advanced form validation**: Integrate more sophisticated validation rules and error handling to ensure robust and user-friendly forms.
